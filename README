Files for Iowa State ddRADseq workshop
Time: Weds, Jan 6. 1-5 pm
Place: Bessey 255.

*Install Instructions*: 
All Platforms:

You'll need the STACKS pipeline. http://catchenlab.life.illinois.edu/stacks/
Download it and click through the installer.

Linux:
You already have a terminal and a plain-text editor. All you need is the Anaconda distribution of python (which has scipy, numpy and matplotlib): https://www.continuum.io/downloads
Mac:

Same as the Linux instructions. The native plain text editor isn't fantastic, so you may also want one, such as TextWrangler: http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/

Windows:

Your job is unfortunately a little more involved. Install the Anaconda distribution of python linked above. If you have a UNIX/LINUX terminal emulator with which you're happy, then you don't need to install one. If you don't, or the previous sentence didn't make sense to you, install Git Bash: https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash

If you have a plain text editor with which you're happy, that's fine. If you need one, install BBEdit: http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/

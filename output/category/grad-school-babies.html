                <p>I went to the <a href="http://vertpaleo.org/Annual-Meeting/Home.aspx">SVP annual meetings</a> last week to do a talk and a <a href="http://phylo.wikidot.com/beastmaster#toc0">workshop</a>. Here are some things that I learned about conferencing internationally while pregnant.</p>
<ul>
<li>I kind of wish I had bought the compression socks for the long flight. But I got up and stretched often and kept hydrated and recovered quickly on the ground. </li>
<li>Drinking fountains are not as common in non-US countries, so check ahead if the tapwater is good.</li>
<li>Pack some saltines. Even though I didn't have morning sickness before leaving, the upset of travel left me a little ill. Wish I had done this.</li>
<li>Room snacks. This is what kept me from becoming a monster. I packed nuts, dried fruit and pretzels. Bought plums and yogurt in Berlin. For contrast, hotel breakfast was like 20 bucks.</li>
<li>The caffeine limitation is just bad news. Sorry, lady.</li>
<li>Schedule important meetings early in the week. If you're ill and can't make it, you still have time to reschedule.</li>
<li>Be proactive about things to which you would like to go versus things to which you <em>must</em> go. I needed mid-day rest, and found it hard to go to talks immediately after lunch. Everybody's different, and your body is pretty good about telling you what it needs.</li>
<li>Networking is harder. I was too tired to be out super late. If you saw a talk, and you liked it, and you know that you'll be immobile by 10 pm, be forward about trying to get together with that person.</li>
<li>Be focused. When people find out you're pregnant, they might want to talk about their experiences having a kids and ask you questions about the baby. They're happy for you! But if there's something you <em>need</em> out of that interaction, practice good steering and keep the conversation on track.<ul>
<li>Relatedly: I'm an open book; I realize not everyone is. Decide what your boundaries are for discussion in a professional setting, and politely defend them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I got a lot out of this meeting, without feeling like I was stretching myself too thin. Add your own helpful conference stuff in the comments.</p><p>There are <a href="http://wrightaprilm.github.io/conferences.html#disqus_thread">comments</a>.</p>            </article>
